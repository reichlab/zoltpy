These estimates were statistically summarized \r\n    and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 \r\n    infections and patients needing critical care were calculated for 21-day and 42-day time periods \r\n    starting from April 2, 2020 to May 13, 2020 for a reactive pattern of 40% contact reduction \r\n    (\"60contact\") through actions such as social distancing. Multiple national public and private \r\n    datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level hospital critical care \r\n    bed counts that include currently available beds and those that could be made available under \r\n    four surge response scenarios – very low, low, medium, and high – as well as deaths in counties \r\n    that had exceeded their hospital critical care capacity limits.\r\ncitation: \"Sen Pei, Jeffrey Shaman, Initial Simulation of SARS-CoV2 Spread and Intervention Effects in the Continental US. medRxiv.doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040303;  Flattening the curve before it flattens us: hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases in US counties. https://behcolumbia.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/flattening-the-curve-before-it-flattens-us-20200405b.pdf\"",
